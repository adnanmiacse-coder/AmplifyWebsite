## Manim Visualization Pipeline

Manim is used as a server-side rendering engine for short, concept-focused visual explanations. The browser requests a visual from the tutor interface, while the Python/FastAPI service performs code generation and video rendering. The generated MP4 is then played by the normal HTML5 video player.

#### Request-to-video flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A[Lesson text or tutor prompt] --> B[Frontend fetchAnimatedVisual]
   B --> C[FastAPI POST /generate]
   C --> D[OpenRouter LLM generates Manim Python]
   D --> E[AST syntax validation]
   E --> F[Pre-flight API and undefined-name checks]
   F --> G[Manim Community Edition render]
   G --> H[MP4 moved to backend/videos]
   H --> I[GET /videos/job-id.mp4]
   I --> J[Autoplay loop in lecture visual panel]
```

#### Implementation details

1. **Prompt construction:** `generate_manim_code()` sends the lesson topic and optional context to an OpenRouter-compatible chat client. The model is instructed to return executable Python, use a `Scene` class based on `MovingCameraScene`, and prefer a small set of reliable Manim primitives such as `Text`, `Circle`, `Line`, `Arrow`, `VGroup`, `Create`, `Write`, and `Transform`.
2. **Pre-render validation:** The service parses generated code with Python `ast`. If the first response has invalid syntax, it retries with a simpler generation prompt. `sanitize_code()` also checks for undefined names and known camera API mistakes, then asks the LLM for a corrected version before rendering.
3. **Rendering:** Each request receives an eight-character UUID job ID. The generated scene is written to `backend/scenes/scene_<job-id>.py`. Manim is invoked through the same Python interpreter as FastAPI with low-quality preview rendering (`-ql`), the `Scene` class, and a job-specific media directory. This produces a 480p15 MP4 that is moved to `backend/videos/<job-id>.mp4`.
4. **Reliability controls:** The endpoint checks that Manim is installed before generation, retries failed renders up to three times, regenerates simpler code for syntax failures, and asks the LLM to repair other render errors. A render that exceeds the 120-second subprocess timeout returns a gateway timeout instead of leaving the request hanging.
5. **Frontend delivery:** The frontend calls the deployed FastAPI `/generate` endpoint, receives the `video_url`, and creates a blob URL for the returned MP4. The lecture panel displays it in a muted, autoplaying, looping `<video>` element. If generation fails, the UI shows its configured fallback visual.

Manim is a generated-media subsystem, not the browser's 3D engine. Three.js remains responsible for interactive lab scenes, while Manim is responsible for deterministic explanatory animations rendered on the backend.

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

Amplify uses separate storage mechanisms for different data shapes instead of forcing authentication, graph relationships, and document search into one database. Laravel is the system of record for relational application data; the tutor uses graph and browser-local stores for learning context.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
   UI[Frontend applications] -->|Auth and classroom API| L[Laravel API]
   UI -->|Tutor graph queries when enabled| N[Neo4j]
   UI -->|Document chunks, TF-IDF index, chat snapshot| LS[Browser localStorage]
   L --> SQL[(SQL database)]
   F[FastAPI AI service] --> N
   F --> V[Generated videos and scene files]
   SQL -. optional cache or queue driver .-> R[(Redis)]
```

### 1. Laravel SQL database: transactional application data

Laravel reads the connection from `DB_CONNECTION` and defaults to SQLite when no value is supplied. The repository includes migrations for:

- `users`, including the student/teacher role used by authentication and classroom authorization
- `personal_access_tokens` for Laravel Sanctum API tokens
- `classrooms`, owned by a teacher and identified by a unique enrollment code
- `classroom_student`, the many-to-many relationship between students and classrooms
- `classroom_notifications`, messages associated with a classroom
- Laravel's cache and queue support tables

For containerized deployment, `docker-compose.yml` provisions MySQL 8.0 as the `db` service. The PHP application connects to it through `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD`. MySQL is the intended production-style relational backend in the included Docker setup, while SQLite is convenient for local development and tests. PostgreSQL and MariaDB are also defined as Laravel adapters in `config/database.php`, but they are not separately provisioned by the repository's Docker Compose file.

### 2. Neo4j: optional knowledge graph for tutor relationships

Neo4j stores relationships that are naturally represented as a graph: document concepts, topic connections, prerequisites, and learning-state links such as mastered or struggling. The tutor frontend connects through Neo4j's transactional HTTP endpoint when `NEO4J_HOST`, `NEO4J_USER`, and `NEO4J_PASS` are available. The Python service also exposes a `/neo4j` proxy backed by the official async Neo4j driver and `NEO4J_URI`/`NEO4J_PASS` environment variables.

Neo4j is optional. On startup or connection failure, the tutor falls back to browser storage rather than making basic document study depend on an external graph database. This makes the feature usable in local or offline-oriented deployments while preserving richer graph traversal when Neo4j is configured.

### 3. Browser-local TF-IDF store: document retrieval fallback

The document tutor parses and chunks uploaded material in the frontend. Its local retrieval path uses a TF-IDF vector store rather than a hosted vector database. A document snapshot includes chunk text, page numbers, token statistics, graph metadata, and chat history, and is stored in `localStorage` under `amplify_tutor_documents`.

The local store is bounded to the most recent 20 documents. It supports offline study and keeps retrieval state in the browser. When Neo4j is enabled, graph metadata can be synchronized there; localStorage remains the fallback and the client-side cache for the tutor experience.

### 4. Redis, queues, and cache configuration

Laravel defines Redis connections for the default and cache databases and supports Redis as a queue, cache, session, or application backend through environment configuration. Redis is not required by the core Docker Compose definition, which currently provisions MySQL only. Deployments that need background rendering, high-volume classroom events, or shared cache state can enable Redis with the corresponding Laravel `REDIS_*`, `CACHE_STORE`, `QUEUE_CONNECTION`, or `SESSION_DRIVER` variables.

### Data ownership summary

| Data | Primary store | Purpose | Required? |
|------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Users, roles, classrooms, memberships, notifications | Laravel SQL (SQLite/MySQL/etc.) | Transactions, authorization, and durable application records | Yes |
| Concepts, prerequisites, and learning relationships | Neo4j | Graph traversal and knowledge context | Optional |
| PDF chunks and local tutor snapshots | Browser `localStorage` with TF-IDF index | Offline-capable retrieval and session continuity | Fallback path |
| Rendered Manim MP4 files | FastAPI `backend/videos` directory | Visual delivery through `/videos` | Created per render |
| Cache, queue, and session state | Laravel file/database/Redis drivers | Operational scaling and asynchronous work | Configurable |

## NCTB Textbook Q&A Assistant

Amplify also includes a dedicated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for Class 11-12 NCTB textbook questions. The assistant grounds its answers in the selected textbook rather than relying only on the language model's general knowledge. It supports English, Bangla, and ICT materials and is available as a standalone deployed application on Hugging Face:

**Live chatbot:** [NCTB Textbook Q&A Assistant on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/addyjeddy/book-chatbot-better/tree/main)

### Capabilities

- **Multi-subject support:** English, Bangla (বাংলা), and ICT textbooks
- **Hybrid retrieval:** Combines semantic similarity from FAISS with keyword matching to retrieve relevant textbook passages
- **LLM inference:** Uses Groq-hosted models, including GPT-OSS 120B, with a configurable model mapping
- **Language-aware processing:** Performs Bengali spelling correction when needed and preserves the language of the student's question
- **Voice input:** Uses the browser Web Speech API for English and Bengali speech-to-text input
- **Conversation history:** Saves conversations with timestamps and restores them across browser sessions
- **Revision export:** Generates PDF revision material from chat history, including Noto Sans Bengali font support
- **Graceful failures:** Retries transient API errors with exponential backoff and provides a useful response when a retrieval or model service is unavailable

### RAG architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   Q[Student question] --> S[Subject selection]
   S --> R1[FAISS semantic search]
   S --> R2[Keyword matching]
   R1 --> M[Merge and rank context]
   R2 --> M
   M --> C[Textbook-grounded prompt]
   C --> G[Groq LLM inference]
   G --> H[Save chat history]
   H --> A[Display answer or export PDF]
```

The retrieval process searches the FAISS index for the selected textbook and combines the best semantic results with keyword matches. The resulting context is truncated to a controlled size before it is passed to the LLM, which reduces irrelevant context and helps keep answers grounded in NCTB content. The default retrieval configuration is:

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Semantic results (`semantic_k`) | 3 | Top vector-similarity matches |
| Keyword results (`keyword_n`) | 2 | Additional exact or lexical matches |
| Combined results (`max_results`) | 4 | Maximum context documents sent onward |
| Per-document limit (`truncate_chars`) | 800 characters | Keeps individual passages focused |
| Total context limit (`context_chars`) | 2,000 characters | Bounds the final prompt context |

### Technology stack and index structure

- **Interface:** Gradio with custom responsive dark-theme CSS
- **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`
- **Vector database:** FAISS (`faiss-cpu`) with 384-dimensional multilingual embeddings
- **Language model:** Groq API using `openai/gpt-oss-120b` by default
- **PDF generation:** FPDF with Noto Sans Bengali font support
- **Speech recognition:** Browser-side Web Speech API
- **Conversation persistence:** JSON-backed history and browser session persistence

Each textbook index contains document embeddings, source and chapter metadata, and a document store containing the original passage text. The expected index directories are:

- `nctb_english_index_v2` - English textbook
- `nctb_bangla_index_v2` - Bengali textbook
- `nctb_ict_index_better` - ICT textbook

### Running the chatbot locally

The standalone chatbot requires Python 3.8 or newer, a Groq API key, and approximately 2-4 GB of disk space for the textbook indexes. Install its dependencies and configure the key before starting Gradio:

```bash
pip install gradio langchain-community langchain-huggingface langchain-groq faiss-cpu fpdf sentence-transformers
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key-here"
python app.py
```

The local interface is served at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. Place the pre-built FAISS indexes in the application root before asking questions. The active model can be changed through the model mapping, for example:

```python
GROQ_MODELS = {
   "GPT-OSS 120B": "openai/gpt-oss-120b",
}
```

### Typical interaction flow

1. The student selects a textbook and types or speaks a question.
2. The assistant optionally corrects Bengali spelling.
3. Hybrid retrieval searches the selected FAISS index.
4. Retrieved passages are assembled into a grounded system prompt.
5. Groq generates the answer using the chosen model.
6. The question and answer are saved to history for later review or PDF export.

For questions outside the selected textbook, students can rephrase the question or choose a more relevant subject. If an index cannot be loaded, check that its directory is in the application root and that the process has read permission. If responses are slow, the first request may be loading the embedding model and FAISS index into memory.

### Flutter application architecture

   T --> AP[Applink SMS and subscription APIs]
   T --> CAAS[CaaS billing and messaging API]
```

The app follows a modular client-server architecture. Flutter provides the cross-platform UI, while Dart feature modules communicate with a custom PHP backend through RESTful HTTP requests. Provider coordinates shared application state, loading states, and feature-level updates. Content that is needed repeatedly is cached locally, allowing core learning experiences to remain available when connectivity is intermittent or unavailable.

The backend is hosted on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu environment and uses local JSON/text storage for the app's server-side records. External services provide AI generation through the Llama API, OTP and SMS delivery through Applink, subscription operations through the Applink subscription service, and carrier billing or messaging through the CaaS API.

### Flutter technology stack

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Application framework | Flutter and Dart | Cross-platform mobile interface and application logic |
| State management | Provider | Reactive state, service access, and feature coordination |
| Networking | `http` package | REST API requests to the PHP backend and external services |
| Web parsing | `html` package | Parsing web-based academic and opportunity content |
| Local persistence | `shared_preferences` | Lightweight settings, cached content, and offline state |
| 3D content | `model_viewer_plus` | Displaying interactive 3D educational models |
| Embedded content | `webview_flutter` | Presenting compatible web learning experiences inside the app |
| Speech | `flutter_tts` | Reading learning content aloud |
| Device input | `sensors_plus` | Accessing device sensor data for interactive experiences |
| Charts | `fl_chart` | Progress tracking and data visualization |
| Analytics | `firebase_core`, `firebase_analytics` | Firebase initialization and usage analytics |

### Offline-first design

Offline support is a core part of the mobile experience rather than an afterthought. The app can cache downloaded learning content and lightweight user preferences through `shared_preferences`. Students can therefore revisit selected lessons, basic lab material, quizzes, and other downloaded resources without maintaining a continuous connection. When the connection returns, network-backed features such as AI assistance, live academic updates, SMS operations, and subscription actions can communicate with their respective services.
